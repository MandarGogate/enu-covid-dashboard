      <p>Our project is a Scottish government-funded initiative to better understand how public health policy in response to COVID-19 has affected people’s daily lives. We’re interested in using social media to follow how people are feeling in real time, and help policymakers make decisions about how to help people during this challenging time.</p>

<p>We plan to build a web-based dashboard that will use AI to show how people are coping with the health and social policy impacts related to the pandemic, and let policy makers, public health and clinical practitioners get continuous insights into how the public is responding. We’re interested in providing the most up-to-the-minute reflection of evolving COVID-19 trends on social media platforms, such as public sentiment and attitudes towards social distancing, travel restrictions, lockdown and other public health policies. </p>

<p>We believe this will be a valuable resource to help us make better decisions around how to react to public health crises, as individuals and also as a nation.</p>

<h2 id="our-sources">Our Sources</h2>

<p>We will be drawing from a number of sources of public social media data for this project, among which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twitter</li>
  <li>Instagram</li>
  <li>Facebook</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be collaborating with Facebook’s <a href="https://www.crowdtangle.com/">Crowdtangle</a> platform to get further insights into how people in the UK are expressing their feelings.</p>
