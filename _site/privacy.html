<p>This project is being carried out by Edinburgh Napier University. Further information on the institution can be found here: <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">napier.ac.uk</a>. Edinburgh Napier University is the Data Controller for your information.</p>

<p>This privacy notice explains how we use your personal information and your rights regarding that information.</p>

<h2 id="what-information-are-we-collecting">What information are we collecting?</h2>
<p>We will be collecting the text of public social media postings made by people in the UK. In order to do this, we will need to collect locations which are attached to posts, and the date and time of creation.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-we-collecting-your-data">Why are we collecting your data?</h2>
<p>We are collecting this data to understand how people are responding to public health policy around the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2 id="how-will-we-use-your-data">How will we use your data?</h2>
<p>We will be using the texts of these public posts to understand how people are feeling. We will use a set of automated tools to look at large groups of public messages and understand what feelings are being expressed. Then, we will make some visualisations to help us understand how public health policy is being talked about, how that changes over time, and which issues are of most concern to which broad areas of the country.</p>

<p>We will not show your personal information, or even the contents of any single public message, to anyone who looks at our charts or dashboards.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-we-sharing-your-information-with">Who are we sharing your information with?</h2>
<p>We are collaborating with researchers from Edinburgh University – no one else will have access to any of the data we gather from social networks directly.</p>

<p>We plan to share our research for other scientists to learn from, but when we do we will make sure that we anonymise all of the information so that no one can be identified from anything that we publish. We will keep a set of that data in our archives for five years following publication.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-rights">What are your rights?</h2>
<p>Under data protection law, you have rights including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your right of access - You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information.</li>
  <li>Your right to rectification - You have the right to ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.</li>
  <li>Your right to erasure - You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances.</li>
  <li>Your right to restriction of processing - You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your information in certain circumstances.</li>
  <li>Your right to object to processing - You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.</li>
  <li>Your right to data portability - You have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:covidtracker@napier.ac.uk">covidtracker@napier.ac.uk</a> if you would like to make a request.</p>
